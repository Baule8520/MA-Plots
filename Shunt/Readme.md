# Shunt

## Main Purpose

I measured how accurate Shunt current measurement is...

- 0.1 Ohm shunt with Arduino ADC

## Circuit Diagrams

- For the shunt measurement:

Will follow...

## Software

- [Shunt](https://github.com/PaulusElektrus/Uno_Shunt) --> 0.1 Ohm shunt

## Plots

Can be found under /results.

## Findings

- The 0,1 Ohm shunt results with the arduino are acceptable, but with 3 A shunt is getting warm and results are getting bad...
- Also there is some unlinearity
- To compare with Hall Sensor see [here](https://github.com/PaulusElektrus/MA-Plots/tree/main/Hall_Sensor/results) --> plot file ends with _shunt.svg
