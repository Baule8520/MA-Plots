# Inverter

I measured the efficiency of grid tied inverters.

## Circuit Diagram

Circuit diagram will follow perhaps...


Measuring Scheme: 
        
        Lab Power Supply --> Multimeter --> Inverter --> calibrated Eastron SDM120 Modbus power meter --> Power Grid

IMPORTANT: 

        At first I additionally hooked a multimeter on the AC side but it is very very unprecise and said more than 100 % efficiency !

## Used Inverters

    - GMI 100W
    - GMI 300W (preferably use)

## Plots

Can be found under /results.
